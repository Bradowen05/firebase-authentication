## Review


### Issues
1. All good

### Next Steps
1. Create a new nextjs project called **basic-auth**
2. Create two new pages **/login** and **/dashboard**
3. Create a .env.local file in the route of your app
4. Add these inside your .env.local file
```
EMAIL=william@gmail.com
PASSWORD=Hgha23GSa£
```
5. I want you to build a landing page using [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)
    - Navbar (with login button which routes to **/login**)
    - Content
    - Footer
6. Build your login page to take an email and password, and compare to the email and password in .env.local. If they match, route the user to **/dashboard** and display their email
7. Implement a theme change button to toggle between light and dark mode on all pages
